Dear Editors:

We are submitting our manuscript, “Inferring the differences in incubation-period and generation-interval distributions of the Delta and Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2”, for consideration for publication in PNAS.
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic underlines the importance of accurately estimating the transmission advantages and infection characteristics of emerging variants.
Here, we provide and apply a significant refinement of the underlying theory, showing that the observed differences in the incubation periods (i.e., time between infection and symptom onset) of the Delta and Omicron variants are largely driven by the differences in their epidemic growth rates.
This material has not previously been published elsewhere. 

Epidemiological delays, such as the incubation period and generation interval (i.e., time between when an infector is infected and when they infect another individual), provide useful measures for characterizing transmission dynamics of a pathogen.
However, estimating their distributions depend on epidemic dynamics:
for example, when an epidemic is growing rapidly, we are more likely to observe recent infections, who will also have shorter incubation periods.
Recent studies have estimated that the incubation periods of Omicron infections are shorter than those of Delta infections but neglected this dynamical bias.

In this article, we analyze epidemic dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 from the Netherlands and show that the observed differences in the incubation periods of the Delta and Omicron variants can be explained by the differences in their epidemic dynamics.
At the end of 2021, the incidence of Omicron infections were increasing while the incidence of Delta infections were decreasing---this means that we are more likely to observe shorter incubation periods for Omicron infections and longer incubation periods for Delta infections.
When we account for the growth rate differences, we estimate that both variants have similar incubation-period distributions.
However, despite similarities in their incubation-period distributions, we estimate a considerably shorter generation interval for the Omicron variant;
we tentatively hypothesize that these differences can be explained by higher effective reproduction number of the Omicron variant, which can cause faster susceptible depletion around the contact network.
Finally, we show that accounting for differences in generation-interval distribution is critical for accurately estimating the transmission advantage of the Omicron variant.

The manuscript and its findings should be of interest to a broad range of readers. All code is available as open-source for use, re-use, and adaptation by the community. We request an expedited review. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions.

Thank you for your consideration of our submission.

Sincerely,

Sang Woo Park
